We introduce the Characterization of Semantic Impact for IMD (CSI-IMD) dataset (Accepted to WACV 2025), which focuses on localizing and evaluating the semantic impact of image manipulations to counter advanced generative techniques. Our evaluation of 10 state-of-the-art IMD and localization methods on CSI-IMD reveals that existing state of the art methods do not adapt well to unseen manipulation signatures. Unlike existing datasets, CSI-IMD provides additional semantically focused annotations beyond traditional manipulation masks, aiding in the development of new defensive strategies. The proposed dataset contains two sets. A gold standard set containing 1,000 manually filtered manipulated images containing all 6 annotation types. A expanded set that contains 500,000 semantically impactful manipulated imaged  generated through the automated pipeline below. Details of both the gold standard set and expanded set can be found in the summary section.

## Dataset Summary 

**Gold Standard Set:** Contains 1,000 manually filtered manipulated images generated by stable diffusion and 1,000 pristine images gathered from the [GSV Cities](https://github.com/amaralibey/gsv-cities) and [Road Vehicle Image](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashfakyeafi/road-vehicle-images-dataset) Dataset. All image manipulation localization and semantic significance ranking experiments were done on the gold standard set.  

 
 **Gold Standard Set Annotations:** </br>
		- **isManipulated Binary Flag:** Indicates if the image is manipulated.</br>
		- **Manipulation Object Class:** The object class of the spliced manipulation.</br>
		- **Manipulation Mask:** A pixel-level mask showing all pixels that have been manipulated.</br>
		- **Semantically Relevant Manipulation Mask:** A pixel-level mask highlighting all pixels related to the manipulation object class (ex. Burning Building).</br>
		- **Semantic Significance Score:** A score from 0 to 1 measuring the extent of semantic change in the image scene.</br>
		- **Semantic Significance Ranking:** A score from 1 to 5 indicating the manipulationâ€™s SS for each image scene. </br>
</br>
	**Semantic Significance Categories:** Low, Medium, High
</br>

**Expanded Set:** Contains 500,000 automated manipulated images generated using the stable diffusion generation pipeline above. This dataset's purpose is to give the community a large scale image manipulation dataset that contains semantically significant manipulations. Our goal is to inspire future research in analyzing image manipulations under a semantic threat assessment mindset.

**Expanded Set Manipulation Types**:</br>
	- Mudslide (100,000 Samples)</br>
	- Flood (100,000 Samples)</br>
	- Military Tank (100,000 Samples)</br>
	- Destroyed Car (100,000 Samples)</br>
	- Police Car (100,000 Samples)</br>
 
**Expanded Set Annotations:** </br>
	- **isManipulated Binary Flag:** Indicates if the image is manipulated.</br>
	- **Manipulation Object Class:** The object class of the spliced manipulation.</br>
	- **Manipulation Mask:** A pixel-level mask showing all pixels that have been manipulated.</br>

## Image Manipulation Semantic Significance Ranking Task
![fig1_compressed-1](Figures/task.png)
We propose a new semantically focused image forensics task called the Semantic Significance Ranking task. All participating methods are given manipulated images in groups of five. All five image manipulations are done on the same natural image. This ensure that the only difference between all images in each image group is the image manipulation itself. The image forensics task is to rank these five manipulations based on their semantic significance. Semantic Significance is defined as the semantic impact a given image manipulation has on the image scene from a semantics perspective.
